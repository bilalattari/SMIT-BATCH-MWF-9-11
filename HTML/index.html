       <p>In the rest of the chapter you
        will meet some more elements
        that will help you when you are
        adding text to web pages. For
        example, you are going to meet
        the <em> element that allows
        you to indicate where emphasis
        should be placed on selected
        words and the blockquote
        element which indicates that a
        block of text is a quotation.
        Browsers often display the
        contents of these elements in
        a different way. For example,
        the content of the em
        element is shown in italics,
        and a blockquote is usually
        indented. But you should not
        use them to change the way that
        your text looks; their purpose is
        to describe the content of your
        web pages more accurately.
        The reason for using these
        elements is that other programs,
        such as screen readers or search
        engines, can use this extra
        information. For example, the
        voice of a screen reader may add
        emphasis to the words inside
        the em element, or a search
        engine might register that your
        page features a quote if you use
        the blockquote element.</p>
